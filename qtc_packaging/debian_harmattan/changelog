ghostsoverboard (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another set of levels
  * Highscore for individual levels and levelsets. Only completed levels
    are counted in the levelset score (not restarted ones). Time spent paused
    is not included in the high score times.
  * Vibration works
  * Treshold for ship movement is now 12 degrees instead of 3. Ship no longer
    keeps moving when the device is laying on a table.
  * No longer vulnerable to other programs changing the accelometer frequency:
    ship movement is connected to a timer now instead of arrival of new values.
    Ship speed may have changed a bit because of these changes.
  * Only single instance running at time
  * New application manager icon
  * Harmattan specific packaging issues: added XB-Maemo_Flags and
    XB-MeeGo-Desktop-Entry-Filename fields to the control file
